            Counter-Strike (CS) is a series of multiplayer tactical first-person shooter video games in which teams of
            terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking, assassination) while
            counter-terrorists try to prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue, escort mission). The series began
            on Windows in 1999 with the release of the first game, Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a
            modification ("mod") for Half-Life that was designed by Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe before
            the rights to the mod's intellectual property were acquired by Valve, the developers of Half-Life, who then
            turned Counter-Strike into a retail product released in 2000.
