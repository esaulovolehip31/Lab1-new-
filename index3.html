          <p>Dota is a series of strategy video games. The series began in 2003 with the release of Defense of the
            Ancients (DotA), a fan-developed multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) mod for the video game Warcraft
            III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion, The Frozen Throne. The original mod features gameplay centered
            around two teams of up to five players who assume control of individual characters called "heroes", which
            must coordinate to destroy the enemy's central base structure called an "Ancient", to win the game.
            Ownership and development of DotA were passed on multiple times since its initial release until Valve
            hired the mod's lead designer IceFrog and after a legal dispute with Blizzard Entertainment, the developer
            of Warcraft III, brokered a deal that allowed for Valve to inherit the trademark to the Dota name. </p>
          <p>Dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game by Valve. The game is a sequel to
            Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III:
            Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying
            and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a
            character known as a hero that has unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, players
            collect experience points (XP) and items for their heroes to defeat the opposing team's heroes in player
            versus player (PvP) combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's Ancient, a large
            durable structure located in the center of each base.</p>
